#set page(paper: "a5")
#set heading(numbering: "1.")

#show link: set text(fill: blue, weight: 700)
#show link: underline

正常使用：

你需要在`index.md`文件中配置必要的元信息，和其他文档没有区别。

随后，在`index.md`中添加上`content: /path/to/typst-file.typ`即可，`.typ`文件会替换掉`.md`的所有内容。

你可以随意编辑`.typ`文件，因为我们会使用`typst-cli`进行编译为pdf，保存在`/public/typst/[slug]/filename.pdf`位置。

Welcome to the Typst Playground! This is a sandbox where you can experiment with Typst. You can type anywhere in the editor panel on the left. The preview panel to the right will update live.

= Basics <basics>

Typst is a _markup_ language. You use it to express not just the content, but also the structure and formatting of your document. For example, surrounding a word with underscores _emphasizes_ it with italics and starting a line with an equals sign creates a section heading.

Typst has lightweight syntax like this for the most common formatting needs. Among other things, you can use it to:

- *Strongly emphasize* some text
- Refer to @basics
- Typeset math: $a, b in { 1/2, sqrt(4 a b) }$

That's just the surface though! Typst has powerful systems for scripting, styling, introspection, and more. In the realm of a Typst document, there is nothing you can't automate.

To learn more about Typst, we recommend you to check out our tutorial at https://typst.app/docs/tutorial.

Once you've explored Typst a bit, why not set yourself up a proper editing environment?
